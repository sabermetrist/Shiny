KU Fall 2021 Data 824 Final Project: Shiny App: Fantasy Baseball Analysis

I created this app to assist in comparing some of the top names in fantasy baseball in statistics that would produce 'points': home runs, hits, stolen bases, batting average, and RBI. The data used comes from the Lahman baseball database from the Lahman package in R. I hope to make changes to this in the future to make it run faster and provide more detailed output, but most of all, I hope it is useful for all you fantasy drafters out there!
